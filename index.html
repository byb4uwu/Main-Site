    <h2>Week 8 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>11/3/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 14-2 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- Turns out Rashard Higgins isn't Odell Beckham. Kenny Golladay was quickly ruled out of the game, which doesn't bode well for him suiting up next week. Antonio Brown may not be a luxury for this team, but a necessity.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 12-4 (2)</strong> -- Entered the weekend hit hard by the injury bug (Jones, Carson, Godwin), and bye weeks (James Robinson, McLaurin), so 0-2 was not a shock. Jalen Reagor looks like he could be a useful piece, but who really knows what the volatile Carson Wentz is going to do game to game, let alone play to play.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Ruggs and Kisses: 9-7 (5)</strong> -- The Vikings are perfectly content to only drop back to pass 15 times when Dalvin Cook is ripping off monster runs left and right against the Packers' defense to the tune of 226 scrimmage yards and 4 touchdowns. Best individual performance of the year led to weekly top points honors. Shoutout to Giovani Bernard for doing an acceptable Mixon impression filling in the last two weeks.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Team Double Dipp: 11-5 (3)</strong> -- One week plug-in DeeJay Dallas (yes, that's his real name) delivered! Melvin Gordon continues to get outplayed by Phillip Lindsay--let's see if the coaching staff agrees based on RB usage going forward. The clear loser in the Dalvin Cook bonanza is any part of the Vikings' passing game, including Adam Thielen.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Going Allen: 10-6 (4)</strong> -- Tyler Boyd is on pace for over 1100 receiving yards as he's settled in a Burrow's favorite target. DJ Moore is still frustratingly inconsistent week-to-week. Jimmy Graham resumed ghost status in his revenge game versus the Saints.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Fuck you Mason: 7-9 (7)</strong> -- Great week for all the receivers (Hill, Jones, Metcalf, Corey Davis), but 6.8 points from Joshua Kelley and D'Andre Swift is not usually going to cut it. Jonnu Smith has barely been targeted in the last three weeks, for some reason.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Watson Watsoff: 8-8 (6)</strong> --  Davante showed up as usual, but the rest of the team seemingly took the week off. Zeke Elliott has been a major disappointment--even the best backs need a competent QB to work alongside.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Lock in On That Win: 8-8 (8)</strong> -- Travis Kelce is TE1 until proven otherwise. He's finished first at the position every year since 2016 excluding 2017...when he was second. James Conner has flown under the radar this year, but he's been solid every week since Week 1 with guaranteed high volume in Pittsburgh.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. New England Cheaters: 5-11 (10)</strong> -- Primed for a big two-win week, the Bucs' stack of Evans, Fournette, and Gronkowski finished the job against the Giants. This squad is gearing up for the playoffs.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Judge Jeudy's Court: 6-10 (9)</strong> -- The Bell revenge game was apparently overstated, as Le'Veon totaled under 40 yards. JK Dobbins's usage and production is the only thing to be slightly excited about. Unfortunately, Kittle's broken foot is a catastrophic blow to this team's slim chances.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Beginner's Luck: 4-12 (12)</strong> -- Unconventional strategy starting two running backs from the same team (Taylor and Hines), but one of them had a good game (not the one you would expect). The combined score of the matchup between Tittsburgh Feelers and Beginner's Luck (123.08) was lower than the scores of 3 other teams this week.</p>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-15 (11)</strong> -- This team is trying to give the Jets competition for the opportunity to draft Trevor Lawrence. Jarvis Landry's 4 catches for 52 yards is considered a standout performance compared to his Tittsburgh peers. </p> <br>
