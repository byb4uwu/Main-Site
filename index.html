    <h2>Week 5 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>10/13/2020</h4>

    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 10-0 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- Bittersweet week as it's going to be pretty much impossible to match Dak's stellar play this season with quarterback streamers. 10-0 ain't bad, though!</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 9-1 (2)</strong> -- Will be worth monitoring the effects of Dak's injury on Cooper, Elliott, and Dalton Schultz. Miami's kicker bailed Zach out this week with 22 points.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Ruggs and Kisses: 6-4 (3)</strong> -- Came up just short in bid for 2-0 week due to a couple in-game injuries to Dalvin Cook and Keenan Allen. Trouble could be brewing if these issues linger while navigating bye weeks.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Fuck you Mason: 5-5 (8)</strong> -- Jonnu Smith has put himself in the conversation for top 5 tight end in the league. Now on a nice two week winning streak, maybe a trade for a running back upgrade could be in the cards?</p> <br>

    <p><strong>5. Going Allen: 6-4 (4)</strong> -- Had a chance to knock off Zach, but Josh Allen, Devin Singletary, and the Bills were disappointing in the Tuesday night matchup against the Titans. Losing by 1 point to Judge Jeudy's Court adds salt to the wound.</p> <br>

    <p><strong>6. Team Double Dipp: 6-4 (5)</strong> -- Really rough week, but lucked out a victory with a cakewalk against Beginner's Luck. Is JuJu about to be passed over by rookie Chase Claypool in Big Ben's pecking order?</p> <br>

    <p><strong>7. New England Cheaters: 3-7 (6)</strong> -- Odell Beckham Jr. had his best game as a Brown, accounting for 3 TDs. Injuries to Bucs' Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette are worth monitoring. Alvin Kamara has been RB1 on the season. There is a lot to like, but hard luck has this team at 3-7.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Watson Watsoff: 5-5 (9)</strong> --  The 1-2 RB punch of Gurley and Henderson did work this week (43.3 combined). The impending return from bye/injury for Davante Adams will be an upgrade over all Watson's current receivers. Add Godwin back into the mix and this team could go on a nice run.</p> <br>

    <p><strong>9. Lock in On That Win: 4-6 (7)</strong> -- After their best performance of the year last week, nothing was working right on Sunday. Only Aaron Rodgers and Travis Kelce reached double digit fantasty points. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Judge Jeudy's Court: 3-7 (11)</strong> -- Best week of the season for Judge Jeudy's Court, nearly reaching 130 points. Raheem Mostert's return is a step in the right direction for fixing RB issues.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Beginner's Luck: 2-8 (10)</strong> -- Hopefully DJ Chark's injury isn't serious. Michael Thomas fought somebody--on his own team? Michael Gallup's impressive connection down the sideline with the Red Rifle was the difference for the Cowboys against the Giants. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-9 (12)</strong> -- Darren Waller is a beast? Baltimore defense had 19 fantasy points? Broke 100 fantasy points this week? Gotta point out the positives, even when they're few and far between.</p> <br>
