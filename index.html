    <h2>Week 4 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>10/6/2020</h4>

    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 8-0 (Last week: 2)</strong> -- The Fresh Prince has unseated Zach and for the top spot and is now the only undefeated team! Kareem Hunt vaults into top 10 RB status with Nick Chubb out for an extended time. The play of Kenyan Drake and CEH since Week 1 may be the only questions left to answer for the team. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 7-1 (1)</strong> -- Calvin Ridley's goose egg turned sure victory into defeat on Monday. On the bright side, this roster is oozing with talent and production. Through Week 4, Zach has RB2, RB4, RB5, and RB6 (Jones, Elliott, Carson, Robinson) all rostered, not to mention WR1 and WRS (Ridley and Cooper).</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Ruggs and Kisses: 5-3 (6)</strong> -- Joe Mixon finally had the blowout performance his manager has been awaiting. Dalvin Cook continue to hog touches and rack up fantasy points in the skinny Vikings' offensive tree. Back-to-back weeks leading the league in points has the arrow pointing up for Ruggs and Kisses.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Going Allen: 6-2 (4)</strong> -- Lucked out in a down week with a 1-1 record. DJ Moore has disappointed in the Panthers offense, but Will Fuller has produced in every game he's been healthy--one of the only things going right for Houston.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Team Double Dipp: 5-3 (3)</strong> -- Losing Derrick Henry and JuJu Smith-Schuster this week due to a COVID cancellation made matchups an uphill battle. Facing the last place team helped to pick up a win. Were Tyler Higbee's last five games of 2019 an aberration? Who's to say with Sean McVay calling plays.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. New England Cheaters: 3-5 (5)</strong> -- Odell Beckham Jr. had his best game as a Brown, accounting for 3 TDs. Injuries to Bucs' Mike Evans and Leonard Fournette are worth monitoring. Alvin Kamara has been RB1 on the season.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Lock in On That Win: 3-5 (7)</strong> -- After their best performance of the year last week, nothing was working right on Sunday. Only Aaron Rodgers and Travis Kelce reached double digit fantasty points. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Fuck you Mason: 3-5 (11)</strong> -- Antonio Gibson looks like a great talent stuck in a really bad offense. Nevertheless, he was able to score and propel Fuck you Mason out of the league's doldrums with a two win week. Let's see if this team can find some sense of consistency.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Watson Watsoff: 3-5 (9)</strong> --  Davante Adams was ruled out before Monday Night Football, but Watson Watsoff had no replacement waiting on the bench. This wrecked any chance of defeating Going Allen. Watson eked out a win against Judge Jeudy's Court by less than half a point.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Beginner's Luck: 2-6 (10)</strong> -- The return of Michael Thomas appears to be imminent. Justin Jefferson has impressed as a rookie, but what happened to the usual consistency of Zach Ertz?</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Judge Jeudy's Court: 2-6 (8)</strong> -- The Judge's running backs situation is dire, to say the least. Also, Brandon Cooks ran 39 routes and only was targeted three times. He made zero catches. Yikes.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-7 (12)</strong> -- Just when it looked like things couldn't get worse, Austin Ekeler and Nick Chubb will be out for multiple weeks. It's going to be a long season with top four draft picks sidelined. Is there a Bill O'Brien to fire?</p> <br>
