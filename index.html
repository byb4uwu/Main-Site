<h2>Week 1 Power Rankings</h2>
<h4>9/15/2020</h4>

<p><strong>1. Zach vs. The World: 2-0</strong> -- With four players (Ryan, Ridley, Elliott, and Carson) scoring more than 20 points in Week 1, Zach vs. The World looks like the team to beat in 2020.</p> <br>
<p><strong>2. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 2-0</strong> -- Taking a first-round risk on Clyde Edwards-Helaire is paying immediate dividends. All but one player scored in double digits this week for a start to the season.</p> <br>
<p><strong>3. Team Double Dipp: 1-1</strong> -- Drew a tough draw against Zach, but scored the second most points in Week 1 backed by #LetRussCook and Adam Thielen.</p> <br>

<p><strong>4. Watson Watsoff: 2-0</strong> --  Davante Adams shouldered the load this week with 34.6 points. He may catch 150 balls this year. The strong receiving core behind Adams of Godwin, McLaurin, and Boyd should be enough to propel this team to the playoffs.</p> <br>
<p><strong>5. Going Allen: 2-0</strong> -- Ravaged by injuries to Marlon Mack and Miles Sanders, Going Allen held their own in Week 1, buoyed by Josh Jacobs' 3 rushing touchdowns.</p> <br>
<p><strong>6. Judge Jeudy's Court: 2-0</strong> -- In news which shocks absolutely no one, DeAndre Hopkins had few issues adjusting to Arizona' offense. Second round pick George Kittle's health is the biggest concern.</p> <br>
<p><strong>7. Ruggs and Kisses: 1-1</strong> -- Austin Hooper, Cleveland's big free agent signing, was used more as a blocking tight end than a rookie. RB2 Le'Veon Bell got hurt and continues to disappoint in New York.</p> <br>
<p><strong>8. Fuck you Mason: 0-2</strong> -- Is Mark Ingram already losing his starting role to JK Dobbins? Is Cam Akers not ready to take the reins at RB for the Rams? Only time will tell.</p> <br>
<p><strong>9. New England Cheaters: 0-2</strong> -- Any team led by Patrick Mahomes has a chance, but receivers Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr. need to play a lot better as there is not a lot of depth behind them.</p> <br>
<p><strong>10. Lock in On That Win: 0-2</strong> -- The squad is kicking themselves for starting Carson Wentz over Aaron Rodgers this week. T.Y. Hilton is starting to show his age with a couple of key drops on Sunday.</p> <br>
<p><strong>11. Beginner's Luck: 0-2</strong> -- The team didn't live up to their namesake, falling to 0-2. Michael Thomas' high ankle sprain may linger throughout the season. Jonathan Taylor looks to be in line for more work with Marlon Mack out for the season.</p> <br>
<p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 0-2</strong> -- Really rough Week 1 performance with no running backs, wide receivers, or tight ends reaching double digit points. Nick Chubb's usage by Cleveland is puzzling, as well.</p> <br>
