    <h2>Week 13 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>12/8/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. Zach vs. The World: 18-8 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- Heading into the bye week, this squad is a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders. Yes, I did just combine those two idioms. But seriously, this team is that good behind James Robinson, Chris Carson, and Aaron Jones.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Fuck you Mason: 16-10 (2)</strong> --  I feel like I've written about it five times this season, but if the running backs (Gibson and Swift) are out, it will be tough to get to Week 15. Of course, Tyreek Hill and DK Metcalf can make any deficit disappear. Logan Thomas was a nice little find on the late-season waiver wire.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Watson Watsoff: 16-10 (4)</strong> --  In the final tuneup before the playoffs, Todd Gurley doesn't seem healthy based on his workload. Robby Anderson might be the alpha for the Panthers if D.J. Moore and others are out. All eyes will be on Davante Adams against Detroit's "defense".</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 18-8 (6)</strong> -- Andy Reid almost cost this team a bye by having Clyde Edwards-Helaire dress for the game but not play. Justin Herbert was downright awful as was pretty much the entire team with the exception of Stefon Diggs and Jamison Crowder. The bye could be huge as the team could be at full strength in Week 15 if Kenny Golladay, Mark Andrews, Edward-Helaire return.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. No Ruggs and Kisses: 15-11 (5)</strong> -- Streaming the wrong quarterback (Matt Ryan) has become a weekly occurence. Facing the top two teams heading into the week, locked up two wins and the 6th seed in the playoffs. A number of players could be in line for bounceback games after lackluster Week 13s including A.J. Brown (2 fumbles), Keenan Allen (48 yards), and Matt Ryan.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Going Allen: 17-9 (3)</strong> -- Scoring 90 points the week before the playoffs isn't ideal, but Josh Allen's Monday masterpiece gives some reason for optimism next week. For next week's first-round matchup, Josh Jacobs could be out again, Miles Sanders is untrustworthy at best, and who knows if a receiver can step up in place of Will Fuller?</p> <br>
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Playoffs----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>
    <p><strong>7. Team Double Dipp: 13-13 (7)</strong> -- With a major opportunity to jump up in the standings and sieze a playoff spot, Team Double Dipp fell flat on their faces. Derrick Henry had a rough one in a blowout situation and the Juju/Claypool combo played second fiddle to Dionate Johnson and James Washington. Better luck next year!</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Beginner's Luck: 8-18 (8)</strong> -- You'd think this team was ready to rock 'n roll in the playoffs, as they lead the league in scoring in Week 13 behind Jefferson, Gesicki, and Taylor. Sadly, too little, too late for a team missing Michael Thomas for much of the season.  </p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Lock in On That Win: 13-13 (11)</strong> -- If only there had been more weeks like this one for Lock in On That Win. In an up and down season, the talent was always there, but not usually at the same time. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Judge Jeudy's Court: 12-14 (9)</strong> -- Kyler has really come back down to earth after he stopping running. His passing is average at best, it appears. Get a "real" QB back this week in Drew Lock, Jerry Jeudy had 5 yards receiving (only 5 more than last week). Finishing 0-2 is a fitting ending for a lackluster team.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. New England Cheaters: 7-19 (10)</strong> -- Bye week for the Bucs and New England Cheaters, apparently. With Mahomes and Kamara this should have been a playoff team...Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel are going to be a force to reckoned with next year (if not this year).</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 2-24 (12)</strong> -- It feels good to go out a champion!..err...with a second win on the season. The nightmare is mercifully over, but I've never seen worse injury luck amongst a single team in my life. Here's hoping for positive regression in 2021.<p><br>
