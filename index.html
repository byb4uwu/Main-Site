    <h2>Week 4 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/1/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> (26.48) and <strong>Nick Chubb</strong> (37.8) shouldered the load in <strong>Miguel's Team's</strong> (107.08) first win of the season over <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (95.6). Cheaters struggled mightily across the board with only <strong>Alvin Kamara</strong> (10.4), <strong>Devonta Freeman</strong> (14), and <strong>Mark Andrews</strong> (11.1) topping 10 points (outside of QB). Even <strong>Jameis Winston's</strong> (30.3 on bench) destruction of the Rams' defense wouldn't have been the difference between 4-0 and 3-1 for Cheaters.</p>
    <p>Winston's primary target, <strong>Chris Godwin</strong> (35.2), incredibly topped Mike Evans' yardage from last week and put up two touchdowns for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (145.82). Other contributors to the blowout effort over <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (123) were <strong>Davante Adams</strong> (23) torching the Eagles' secondary and <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> (22.5) punching into the end zone twice. 'Elite'QB reaped the benefits of Jared Goff throwing the ball over 50 times in the form of <strong>Cooper Kupp's</strong> (22.4) 9 catches for over 100 yards. 'Elite'QB's group performed admirably this week, but you can't fix Crazy.</p>
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason's</strong> (125.2) newest trade acquisition, <strong>Wayne Gallman Jr.</strong> (24.8), made a strong opening statement as lead back in New York. The Dolphins porous defense was somehow able to limit true number one receiver <strong>Keenan Allen</strong> (7.3). Continuing the theme of steady receivers being shut down this week, on the other side <strong>Baby got Mack's</strong> (123.1) <strong>Julian Edelman</strong> (5) and <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (4.9) turned in below average Sundays. Following this matchup, Baby got Mack is no longer undefeated and Fuck you Mason has a win, at long last.</p>
    <p>Another previously winless team, <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (119.44) turned in a solid week 4 act by beating <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (82.6). After having very little to work with in the game, a frustrated <strong>Adam Thielen</strong> (1.6) called out his quarterback Kirk Cousins (now 5-27 versus winning teams in his career). <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> (1.5) and <strong>Tom Brady</strong> (4.7) had dud games for Zeke this week, as well. JRV's <strong>Chris Carson</strong> (16.5) didn't fumble this week in Seattle's blowout over Arizona and <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> (14.8) fell into the end zone to save his day. Let's see if JRV can build off this step forward and keep it going in the coming weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (100.62) pulled off the Monday night comeback over <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (95.28). <strong>James Conner</strong> (22.5) finally lived up to his lofty preseason expectations to lead the way, however, <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (3) continues to struggle. <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's T.Y. Hilton</strong> (0) remaining in the lineup when inactive may have been the deciding factor in this week's result for <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong>.</p>
    <p>The largest score margin of the week belonged to the matchup between <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (140.1) and <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (84.7). Double Dipp had steady to above average production from almost every player in his lineup, with the exception of <strong>Phillip Lindsay</strong> (6.5) and <strong>Kyle Rudolph</strong> (1.7). Even <strong>Corey Davis</strong> (17.6), a bust thus far, decided to get in on the scoring action. For Wilson1, the case of the Week 4 missing WR1 extended to <strong>Odell Beckham Jr</strong> (3) and <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> (7.3). Let's see if the top wide receivers around the league can regain their powers next week.</p>

    <p>We're already a quarter of the way through the NFL regular season, which means even more of the fantasy regular season has elapsed. It's time for teams to distinguish themselves atop the standings. As we get towards the middle of the season, keep in the mind upcoming bye weeks when maneuvering your rosters. Keep it up!</p>
