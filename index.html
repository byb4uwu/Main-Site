    <h2>Week 12 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/28/2019</h4>
    <p>Talk about efficiency for <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong> (36.26), who had 5 TD passes, 169 passing yards and 95 rushing yards. <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (148.96) didn't even need Lamar's MVP-caliber performance as <strong>Derrick Henry</strong> (28) erupted, himself. <strong>IWillMakeAComback's</strong> (67.24) team looks kinda like a wilted, unloved plant.</p>
    <p>This week was a <strong>Chris Godwin</strong> (33.9) week (as opposed to a Mike Evans week) for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (123.20). Gurley brought formerly sole first place player <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (94.42) down a notch. Let's see if Mack can turn it around next week, or simply limps into the playoffs on a losing streak.</p>
    <p>In the most surprsing result of the week, <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (112.60) defeated <strong>Superman Barkley</strong> (81.04) despite not having an active QB, Flex, or Kicker. This could play a role in the competition for the 6th and final playoff spot (total points scored). All of Barkley's players underachieved greatly this week, with <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> (11.9) being the leading scorer. </p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (106.62) is trying their best to get back into the playoff hunt. Rolling the dice with Jameis Winston (26.32) over Drew Brees this week paid off. <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (94.06) fell to a third straight loss, and playoffs look to be out of sight, barring an incredible Week 13.</p>
    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (95.68) did the minimum necessary to beat cellar-dweller <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (69.26). It wasn't pretty, but with a record of 7-5, Ridley looks to have a chance to sneak into the playoffs on merit of record. To advance, however, they will need more support from <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (7.88) and <strong>Jamison Crowder</strong> (2.8).</p>
    <p><strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (97.04) lost ground again and now sits on the outside looking in on the playoffs. <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (104.1) moves into a tie for first place, even with <strong>Amari Cooper's</strong> (0) and <strong>Russell Wilson's</strong> (10.5) worst game of the season, respectively.</p>

    <p>Week 13 concludes the regular season, but there is still a lot on the line. The last three playoff spots are at stake, as well as first round byes (top 2). Happy Thanksgiving, set those lineups, and we'll see how it all plays out!</p>
