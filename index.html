<h2>Week 3 Recap</h2>
<h4>9/24/2019</h4>
<p>This week's top scorer was <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (179.06) winning over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (116.1). <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> stars <strong>Mike Evans</strong> (41), <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (26.3), and <strong>Mark Ingram II</strong> (33.5) picked up the slack for the injured <strong>Damien Williams</strong> (0) who remained in the starting lineup. <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (10.7) was limited by the Browns' continued poor O-line play, questionable playcalling by Freddie Kitchens, and the Rams' excellent defense on Sunday night for <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong>. <strong>Darren Waller</strong> (20.6) is quickly becoming Derek Carr's favorite target as he hauled in an incredible 13 of 14 targets for 134 yards. </p>
<p>Lead by a bounceback game by <strong>Jameis Winston</strong> (26.5) against the soft Giants secondary, <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (136.9) continued dominance and unseated last week's top dog <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (115.44). Khalil Mack's and <strong>Chicago's</strong> (13) mangling of Redskins' offensive linemen wasn't enough to compensate for the disappointing performances by receivers <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (8.9), <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> (2.7), and <strong>Marquise Brown</strong> (5.9).</p>

<figcaption><strong>Mack made Jay Gruden look like this a lot on Monday.</strong></figcaption>
<p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (129.12) reached the win column for the first time in 2019, squeaking past <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (127.26) by a hair. <strong>Fuck you Mason's</strong> hopes were dashed by the high ankle sprain of number one fantasy draft pick <strong>Saquon Barkley</strong> (5.7). It remains to be seen how his 233 pound void will be filled. <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy's</strong> day was highlighted by speedster <strong>Mecole Hardman</strong> (17.4) reaching 21 mph on a long touchdown reception from Mahomes.</p>
<p>Moving to 3-0 was <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (128.06) with another strong performance from <strong>Julio Jones</strong> (22.8) and <strong>Cooper Kupp</strong> (27.7). 'Elite'QB's only concern near the top of the standings now might be why <strong>George Kittle</strong> (8.7) isn't getting the ball more often from Jimmy G. <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (117.74) came out on the losing side of the matchup partially due to leaving <strong>James White</strong> (0) in the lineup while the Pats' RB was attending the birth of his child. Grandpa <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> keeps on kickin' with two more touchdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Lindsay's</strong> (27) best performance of the still young season powered <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (116.66) to a second win of the season, defeating <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (104.84). <strong>Calvin Ridley</strong> (1.1), the team's namesake, let the group down, but below average games from <strong>Robert Woods</strong> (7.3) and <strong>James Conner</strong> (5.7) would have made it difficult to compete, anyways.</p>
<p>The final matchup of the week pitted <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (142.04) against lowest scorer of the week <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (67.9). Miguel's roster neglect is certainly paying off--if the goal is a last place finish. On the other hand, Wilson1getmeabeer's squad was anchored by <strong>Russell Wilson's</strong> garbage time fantasy points and potential diamond in the rough TE <strong>Will Dissly</strong> (15.2). </p>
<p>For those of you putting in the work and improving your teams on a weekly basis, keep it up! For those of you slacking off, it's time to get your head in the game. There's still time to save the season, (unlike the Dolphins) but you must start now!</p>
