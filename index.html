    <h2>Week 11 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/19/2019</h4>
    <p>Let's get the biggest snooze fest out of the way first. <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (100.34) more than quadrupled up <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (23.8). <strong>Josh Allen</strong> (33.84) accounted for 4 touchdowns and <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> had his best fantasy game since week 4 and most rushing yards since week 1. This is a good sign for Gurley Gone Crazy's playoff push.</p>
    <p>Another week, another win for <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (112.76). Despite possibly <strong>Deshaun Watson's</strong> (4.96) worst game as a pro, <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (17.2) was dynamic as a pass catcher out of the backfield for Old Man Rivers on Monday night. <strong>Zeke and Destroy's</strong> (97.26) <strong>Tom Brady</strong>-led (8.54) Patriots offense continues to show its flaws.¬†</p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (142.42) showed off their might in week 11, but remained mired in 9th place overall. <strong>John Brown</strong> (30.2) and an emergent <strong>Deebo Samuel</strong> (17.4) paved the way to victory. <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> (74.24) <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (24.6) sadly remains relegated to a bench role.</p>
    <p>Behind the efforts of <strong>Keenan Allen</strong> (17.1), <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (120.38) was able to stave off the comeback attempt by <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (108.18). <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> (16.18), rarely a disappointment, scored his least fantasy points of the season (outside of the game he left with injury). Team Double Dipp is among the teams struggling to make the playoffs.¬†</p>
    <p>The <strong>Jimmy Garropolo</strong> (31.66) critics must shut up for at least a week as Jimmy G passed for 424 yards and 4 TDs (plus, a game winning drive) for <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (122.36). Once again a loser, <strong>Superman Barkley</strong> (100.22) now sits in 10th place. However, on account of having the most points scored outside the top 5 in the standings, Barkley would be in line for a playoff berth if the season ended today.</p>

    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (94.16) got a much needed win over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (57). Next week may be a rough one for Ridley, as <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (16.9), <strong>James Conner</strong> (4.7), <strong>Eric Ebron</strong> (4.7), and <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (3.1) were all injured in their respective games. <strong>Robert Woods</strong> (0) also missed his game due to to a personal issue. JRV lost a precious game in the standings when he left <strong>Matthew Stafford's</strong> (0) fractured back, <strong>Matt Brieda's</strong> bad ankle (0), and <strong>Nobody</strong> (0) in the starting lineup.</p>
    <p>Two weeks remain before the playoffs start. Baby got Mack and Wilson1getmeabeer have both clinched spots. There are still 8(!) teams in the hunt for the remaining 4 spots. Once again, the 6th playoff spot goes to the team with the most points scored outside the top 5. Let's get it!¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†
