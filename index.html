    <h2>Week 6 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>10/20/2020</h4>

    <p><strong>1. Zach vs. The World: 11-1 (Last week: 2)</strong> -- Zeke Elliot's worst game ever with two lost fumbles. Aaron Jones had 15 rushing yards. Cam Newton passed for 157 yards in a brutal loss to the Broncos. You'd think this team had lost by 20. Nope. Two more wins and back on top of the standings.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 11-1 (1)</strong> -- Undefeated no longer! FreshPrince was able to pick up a win despite finishing in the bottom half in scoring. Probably just a down week, but Kenyan Drake having his best game, by far, on the bench stings.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Going Allen: 8-4 (5)</strong> -- Great all-around performance in an overall down week for the most of the teams in the league. Josh Allen kind of looks like he's reverting back to the bad version of himself, but his rushing floor keeps him a safe fantasy option.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Team Double Dipp: 7-5 (6)</strong> -- Derrick Henry turned in a team-saving Sunday for both the Titans and Team Double Dipp. Behind Henry, this team is thin at RB. Getting a win with Russell Wilson on bye helps the cause.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Fuck you Mason: 6-6 (4)</strong> -- Good process. Bad results. Sometimes the manager start all the right guys, yet they still don't come through. Julio Jones returned from injury and played like his typical self with 2 TDs to secure a single win this week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Ruggs and Kisses: 6-6 (3)</strong> -- Hopefully this week is just a blip on the radar with Dalvin Cook, Keenan Allen, and Le'Veon Bell out for various reasons, but it was not a pretty showing from the backups.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Watson Watsoff: 5-7 (8)</strong> --  D'Andre Swift breakout game? I wouldn't count on it with Patricia still running the ship. Every player on this team scored less than projections except Watson, so expect a bounceback next week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Lock in On That Win: 6-6 (9)</strong> -- Tough to watch T.Y. Hilton struggle continually with poor QB play since Luck retired in addition to his own skills decline. Nice to escape with two wins, though.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. New England Cheaters: 3-9 (7)</strong> -- Lowest points in the league was not a case of bad luck this week--starting two players who didn't play led to a predictable losing outcome.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Beginner's Luck: 4-8 (11)</strong> -- This week's top scorer came out of nowhere! Justin Jefferson looks like a leading rookie of the year candidate. This squad can get back into contention with a few more weeks like this one and a healthy Michael Thomas. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Judge Jeudy's Court: 4-8 (10)</strong> -- With another couple big games, Kyler Murray's name should start popping up in MVP conversations. Kittle and Cooks were the only other bright spots this week, but a win is a win and this team can't afford the alternative.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-11 (12)</strong> -- A.J. Green risen from the dead game? Deebo Samuel showed off his explosiveness after the catch on Sunday--nice pickup off waivers in week 6.</p> <br>
