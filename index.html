    <h2>Week 10 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>11/17/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 16-4 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- This team just wants to get the playoffs started. This week, they did enough to get a single win behind strong games by Stefon Diggs (as usual) and Tee Higgins. Kareem Hunt seems to play better alongside Nick Chubb, and his touch floor remains safe even in a shared backfield.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 14-6 (2)</strong> -- Scraped out a win despite not having any players in the lineup find the end zone. James Robinson had two different touchdown runs called back for penalties. Carson Wentz is starting to running out of excuses for his exceedingly poor play, and now he's got most of his offensive supporting cast back.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Going Allen: 13-7 (4)</strong> -- DJ Moore week (4-96-1)! Josh Jacobs week (21-112-2)! Josh Allen receiving TD!?! This is how you win big even when Will Fuller and Travis Fulgham have rough afternoons. A battle is brewing for the second bye between a few teams, including Going Allen.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Team Double Dipp: 13-7 (6)</strong> -- Cole Beasley is a safety blanket (11 catches) for Josh Allen. The JuJu/Claypool combo accumulated almost 40 points in a blowout. Running back is an issue as neither Gordon or Lindsay seem to play well together. The saving grace could be Derrick Henry's December schedule üëÄ.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Fuck you Mason: 11-9 (5)</strong> -- Facing an uphill battle with Tyreek Hill and Julio Jones on bye weeks, DeAndre Swift capitalized on opportunities to be the complete back everyone knows he can be (except Patricia). Maybe grandpa Adrian can get phased out for good in the second half? DK Metcalf got shut down by Jalen Ramsey, but a win is a win.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. No Ruggs and Kisses: 11-9 (3)</strong> -- Matchups against bye-week-depleted Fuck you Mason and 11th place Beginner's Luck was looking like a sure-fire 2-0 week. Instead, disaster struck in the form of a winless week, as every single player underperformed Yahoo projections. Time to throw this one in the trash and look to Week 11.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Judge Jeudy's Court: 10-10 (9)</strong> -- Catch of year by DeAndre Hopkins, thrown by Kyler Murray! J.D. McKissic has been targeted by Alex Smith 33 times this year, while young stud Terry McLaurin only 19 times. Let's see if this team can keep the winning streak (4) alive next week.</p> <br>
    <img class="dak-gif"src="hopkins_catch.jpg" alt="">
    <p><strong>8. Watson Watsoff: 11-9 (7)</strong> --  Darrell Henderson saved his day with a touchdown, but had only 28 rushing yards. His usage has been maddeningly inconsistent in the McVay offense. Diontae Johnson looks like an absolute stud and Johnson/JuJu/Claypool is looking like one of the most potent receiving trios in the league. New acquisition Phillip Linday had two rushing yards in a 1-1 week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Lock in On That Win: 9-11 (8)</strong> -- With opponents Zach vs. The World and Watson Watsoff each scoring under 90 points, whiffed big time by losing both with a score of 84.1 to drop to 9th place. James Conner has been a ghost of late, and CMC looks to be out again next week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Beginner's Luck: 5-15 (11)</strong> -- Justin Jefferson is looking like one of the best fantasy draft picks of the year (13th round). He's been WR15 on the season. Ronald Jones wouldn't have even been my 1000th guess for player who would have a 98+ yard rushing touchdown, but here we are. Michael Thomas has been receiver bust of the year.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. New England Cheaters: 5-15 (10)</strong> -- Tough week at QB with Mahomes on bye and Brees leaving with injury. Still hanging around in the playoff chase on account of total points (15.88 points behind 6th playoff position). Mahomes could make up this deficit by himself over the next three weeks.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>13. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-19 (12)</strong> -- Since the manager's checked out, I'm going to use this space to talk about Nick Chubb and how he made the right play by stepping out of bounds instead scoring at the end of the game. Chubb put the team first, by obeying the coaches' play call to get the first down, but not score. Gotta love a team first guy even if it cost a lot of peoples' fantasy teams (mine included), and the one guy who dropped $100k on Browns -4 (why, though!?!).</p> <br>
