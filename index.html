    <h2>Week 3 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>9/29/2020</h4>

    <p><strong>1. Zach vs. The World: 6-0 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- Chris Carson appears to have avoided serious injury, thankfully. James Robinson (27.9) was the team's top scorer and has been the draft's biggest steal.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 6-0 (2)</strong> -- Undefeated! And not by sheer luck, alone. Getting a healthy Kenny Golladay (14.7) back should help this team sustain success.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Team Double Dipp: 4-2 (4)</strong> -- Derrick Henry (26) had himself the kind of game people have to come to expect of him. Russell Wilson (36.8) continues his rampage of all opposing defenses.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Going Allen: 5-1 (3)</strong> -- A bit of a down week for Josh Jacobs (7.8), but not something to be overly concerned about going forward. Josh Allen is putting himself in the MVP conversation, amazingly.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. New England Cheaters: 2-4 (5)</strong> -- Outside of Alvin Kamara (38.4) and Patrick Mahomes (40!) this was not a good week. However, those two were pretty darn good. Almost 80 combined points from two players probably won't happen every week so others need to step up.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Ruggs and Kisses: 3-3 (12)</strong> -- Worst to first in points scored in a single week! Brady (23.88), Allen Robinson (23.3), Keenan Allen (23.7), and Dalvin Cook (24.9) each chipped in more than 23 points. New additions Mo Alie-Cox (12.5) and Mike Davis (19.1) were immediate contributers, getting the team back to .500.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Lock in On That Win: 3-3 (9)</strong> -- Tyler Lockett's career day (32.5) paved the way to victory. Could Lock in On That Win swing a trade for a wide receiver with one of two productive tight ends Kelce and Fant?</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Judge Jeudy's Court: 2-4 (7)</strong> -- Another average week, however the Kyler/DeAndre (43.4 combined) connection is clicking. Getting another dynamic duo back in Kittle/Mostert would provide a boost.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Watson Watsoff: 2-4 (8)</strong> --  Nobody played poorly, but there were no standout performances outside of Darrell Henderson (18.5). This team needs to steady the ship after two straight weeks of losses.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Beginner's Luck: 1-5 (10)</strong> -- Maybe the Vikings and Beginner's Luck have found another playmaker in Justin Jefferson (27). Zach Ertz could see an uptick in targets with Dallas Goeddert injured.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Fuck you Mason: 1-5 (6)</strong> -- Joshua Kelley (4.2) disappointed a week after receiving 23 carries. Darius Slayton (4.8) could really struggle in a Barkley-less Giants offense.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-5 (11)</strong> -- Nick Chubb (23.5) and Austin Ekeler (25.8) scoring nearly half the team's points has Tittsburgh Feelers searching for answers and a dismal 1-5 record.</p> <br>
