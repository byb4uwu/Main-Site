    <h2>Week 12 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>12/2/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. Zach vs. The World: 16-8 (Last week: 4)</strong> -- Look who's back on top! Zach hopes this week's balanced scoring effort is a precursor for playoff success. Chris Carson and Aaron Jones, who lead the team in the first half, seem to have taken a backseat to James Robinson and others. But that's okay when you put up close to 140 points.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Fuck you Mason: 15-9 (6)</strong> -- Tyreek Hill fifty-burger is about the only way to overshadow a 3 TD game (Antonio Gibson on Thanksgiving)! If this team can get even half this weeks' production from Hill and Gibson the rest of the way and the rest of team plays to projections, a fantasy championship is in sights.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Going Allen: 17-7 (1)</strong> -- Will Fuller's Thansksgiving was really the only notable perforance, but it was enough to get two wins. Of bigger concern is the health of D.J. Moore and Josh Jacobs. Sincere apologies to WR Kendall Hinton for being shoved into impossible situation of playing NFL quarterback for his first ever game. It went pretty much how you would expect.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Watson Watsoff: 15-9 (7)</strong> --  Is Zeke washed? Didn't matter this week, as Deshaun Watson and the D(e/a)vantes carried them to double victory. However, Elliott is going to need to bounce back if this team expects to compete in the playoffs. Robby Anderson, a very underrated receiver, hit 10+ points for the 7th time this year.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. No Ruggs and Kisses: 13-11 (3)</strong> -- Derek Carr had a worse fantasy game than the guy who replaced him in the 4th quarter of the game, Nathan Peterman. It's going to be curtains if Dalvin Cook misses any time or is slowed by injuries. Dallas Goedert seems like he's the only thing working in the Eagles offense right now.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 17-7 (2)</strong> -- Antonio Brown was a distant third option for Brady, Clyde Edwards-Helaire is unneccesary with Mahomes doing all the work in the Chiefs' offense, and Kareem Hunt is hurt by Nick Chubb's triumphant return from injury. These are some major issues for a team which looked like the title favorite in the first half. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Team Double Dipp: 13-11 (5)</strong> -- Even with Derrick Henry putting up his typical heroic, late-season performances, this looks like a sinking ship. Now on the outside of the playoffs looking in, Russell Wilson and company will need to capture some early season magic in do-or-die Week 13.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Beginner's Luck: 6-18 (10)</strong> -- Decent one-win week against playoff teams FreshPrinceofHelaire and Going Allen. Wayne Gallman has been above average as the starter for New York, amazingly. Justin Jefferson put up his third straight 15+ point perforance to lead the charge. For being buried in the standings, this team has surprising depth to be able to weather Jonathan Taylor and Lamar Jackson being on the COVID list. </p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Judge Jeudy's Court: 12-12 (8)</strong> -- Kyler Murray and the Cardinals offense was bottled up by an average at best New England defense. Duke Johnson was the team's bright spot this week, which isn't saying much. Judge Jeudy was brave (or stupid) (or careless) enough to start Jerry Jeudy without an actual quarterback--the decision did not pay off (1 target, 0 catches).</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. New England Cheaters: 7-17 (11)</strong> -- Patrick Mahomes is unreal and if he doesn't win the MVP, then he'll have fallen prey to the same bias of voters as Jordan and Lebron did in their heydays. It's kind of funny that Mike Evans is Brady's favorite red-zone target when most people assumed it would be Godwin or Brown.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Lock in On That Win: 11-13 (9)</strong> -- Once compared to a busted refrigerator by a Yahoo analyst, David Montgomery lead the team this week with his best game of the year. Darius Slayton's goosegg and other poor performances close the book on a difficult season mostly without number one pick Christian McCaffrey.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-23 (12)</strong> -- Almost 50 points from Browns' Landry and Chubb. Less than 15 points from the rest of the players. Players on IR (or A.J. Green) cannot score points.</p> <br>
