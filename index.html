    <h2>Week 9 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>11/10/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 15-3 (Last week: 1)</strong> -- Stefon Diggs might be the most underrated receiver in the league. He's put up double digit points in all but one game this year. Clyde Edwards-Helare only had 5 carries!?! Going back to Bell's first game with KC, CEH has had fewer than 10 carries in three straight games.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 13-5 (2)</strong> -- Hey, Evan Engram finally scored a touchdown this year! A minor miracle with Daniel Jones throwing the passes. Terry McLaurin is matchup-proof and it doesn't even matter who's throwing him the ball. This team could really use Chris Carson and Calvin Ridley to come back healthy, if only to avoid starting JaMychal Hasty and Damien Harris.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. No Ruggs and Kisses: 11-7 (3)</strong> -- Dalvin Cook is a cheat code and is now overall RB1, despite only playing in 6.5 games. A.J. Brown scored for the 5th game in a row and this Ruggsless team lead the league in scoring for the fourth different week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Going Allen: 11-7 (5)</strong> -- Will Fuller's talent has never been in question, but his good health and consistency has never really shown up as a pro. This year, he's proved the doubters (myself) wrong as he's been a top 12 fantasy wide reciever. Lost one matchup by two points, won the other by...a lot.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Fuck you Mason: 9-9 (6)</strong> -- Now manages the top two fantasy receivers in 2020 (Hill, Metcalf), but still has to deal with the uncertainty of rookie running backs (Swift, Gibson). Could Tua be a legitimate fantasy contributor down the stretch? Honorable mention for Teddy Bridgewater, who played an awesome game in a near upset against the Chiefs.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Team Double Dipp: 11-7 (4)</strong> -- JuJu Smith-Schuster as quietly been excellent in his last three games. Derrick Henry was bottled up by the Bears' defense and Adam Thielen was neglected again in a double loss week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Watson Watsoff: 10-8 (7)</strong> --  I talk about him pretty much every week, but it's hard to overrate Davante Adams when he's averaging almost 24 fantasy points per game (2nd place is DK Metcalf with just over 18 fppg). Zeke Elliott putting up David Montgomery-eque statlines is concerning, to say the least.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Lock in On That Win: 9-9 (8)</strong> -- We missed you, Christian McCaffrey. The number one fantasty pick is RB25 on the year--in 3 games! (Melvin Gordon is RB24 for reference). Unfortunately, he may be back on the shelf with a new injury. We hardly knew you, Christian McCaffrey :( </p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Judge Jeudy's Court: 8-10 (10)</strong> -- Kyler Murray is a beast (and QB1)! The dual threat QB had more rushing yards (106) than the rest of Judge Jeudy's running backs combined (55). Jerry Jeudy had his best game as a pro, in the gradually improving Broncos' offense. Alex Smith seems to have found a favorite target out of the backfield in J.D. McKissic (9 catches). It all adds up to a much-needed 2-0 week.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. New England Cheaters: 5-13 (9)</strong> -- The Buccaneers shut down Kamara on the ground for the second time this year. Gronk and Evans suffered from Brady's poor play on Sunday night. This team needs some players to step up as it loses a grip on a playoff spot.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Beginner's Luck: 4-14 (11)</strong> -- A total of 17.5 points from 3 running backs is a tough thing to overcome. D.J. Chark had his best game of the year with rookie Jake Luton under center. Another winless week makes playoffs likely out of reach.</p>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-17 (12)</strong> -- Live look-in...
