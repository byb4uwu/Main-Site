    <h2>Week 7 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>10/27/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 13-1 (Last week: 2)</strong> -- Trading CeeDee Lamb for Justin Herbert when Dak got injured is looking like a shrewd move. Logan Thomas picking on Dallas' defense and scoring was a cherry on top of another 2-0 week. <strike>Is Kenyan Drake any good? He's certainly inconsisent.</strike> Edit: I wrote the Drake part before he got hurt on Sunday night, now I feel a little bad. The good news is Chase Edmonds is going to get his opportunity.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. Zach vs. The World: 12-2 (1)</strong> -- Could be tougher sledding the next couple of weeks with James Robinson going on bye, and Chris Carson and Aaron Jones banged up. The Cowboys don't look too hot either. Shouldn't be much of an issue for a 13-1 team in the meantime.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. Team Double Dipp: 9-5 (4)</strong> -- Another solid week despite Chase Claypool being the clear third option in Pittsburgh. Russell Wilson made an uncharacteristic bad interception, but can't complain about 32 fantasy points.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Going Allen: 9-5 (3)</strong> -- Shanahanigans strike again! McKinnon, expected to be the lead back this week, finishes as the third option and negative rushing yards. Second lowest point total in the league, but fortunate to be playing Beginner's Luck (aka bye week).</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Ruggs and Kisses: 7-7 (6)</strong> -- With top running backs Cook and Mixon out this week, nice to keep afloat with a win behind every defense's nightmare A.J. Brown. Minshew is like a present-day Bortles--looks absolutely terrible but still puts up 18+ fantasy points (as he has 6 out of 7 games).</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Watson Watsoff: 7-7 (7)</strong> --  Davante Adams posted some jaw-dropping numbers (13-196-2) on Sunday, even by his own standards, to lead a monster week. Adams, Godwin, Gurley, Hockenson, McLaurin, and the Chiefs D/ST combined for 9 scores. With receivers putting up these kind of numbers, who cares who's playing running back?  </p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Fuck you Mason: 6-8 (5)</strong> -- It's hard to believe DK Metcalf and AJ Brown were college teammates and how that team ever lost a game. DK's biggest highlight of the night was chasing down Budda Baker about 100 yards after an interception to save a touchdown. Unfortuantely, this doesn't count for any fantasy points :(</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Lock in On That Win: 7-7 (8)</strong> -- Tyler Lockett saw Davante's game and said I can do better: 15-200-3 for 45.5 points. This made things interesting heading into Monday night, but ultimately resulted in 1-1.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Judge Jeudy's Court: 6-8 (11)</strong> -- When the Kyler Murray/DeAndre Hopkins combo is clicking you don't need a lot of help from the rest of the team. Two-win week has Judge entrenched in the playoff race.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. New England Cheaters: 3-11 (9)</strong> -- Losing Odell Beckham Jr. in the first quarter to a torn ACL is a rough break. Mike Evans is really not a preferred target of Tom Brady, even before Antonio Brown gets added to the mix in Week 9. That does not bode well for the coming weeks.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-13 (12)</strong> -- The passing volume for the Bengals is pretty much unprecedented with a rookie QB (Burrow) at the helm. This team is priming to pull off the upset of the year in the near future.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Beginner's Luck: 4-10 (10)</strong> -- ...<br> <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/IVUT6ZrmwluToUnb1F" width="480" height="271" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/nfl-sports-football-sport-IVUT6ZrmwluToUnb1F">via GIPHY</a></p>
