    <h2>Week 11 Power Rankings</h2>
    <h4>11/24/2020</h4>
    <p><strong>1. Going Allen: 15-7 (Last week: 3)</strong> -- Kalen Ballage looks so, so much better than he did as a Dolphin (Adam Gase Syndrome, anyone?). Hunter Henry has now scored in back-to-back weeks after being a big disappointment to date. This has been the most consistent team, with a league-best 10 games scoring 110+ points. Don't mess with these guys.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>2. FreshPrinceofHelaire: 17-5 (1)</strong> -- Justin Herbert already has one of the best deep balls in the game. After reaching 133+ points each of the first five weeks of the year, has only hit this mark once in the last six weeks. Figuring out when Curtis Samuel is going to explode would be nice.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>3. No Ruggs and Kisses: 13-9 (6)</strong> -- Keenan Allen is a target monster, as he hauled in 16/19 targets for 145 yards, including a touchdown. A week after falling short of projections by 53 points, bounced back in a big way with a league high 155 points. Can Michael Pittman Jr. be a factor down the stretch? Maybe we'll find out in Week 12 showdowns with Fuck you Mason and Watson Watsoff.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>4. Zach vs. The World: 14-8 (2)</strong> -- After an 0-2 week, have now lost hold of the second bye with two weeks to go. For as good as Calvin Ridley has become in his second year, the whole Falcons offense breaks down without Julio Jones. Matt Ryan has seen better days. The good news is that this team has a lot of players with high floors. There should be some ceiling coming.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>5. Team Double Dipp: 13-9 (4)</strong> -- The return of Allen Lazard didn't amount to much, but stellar performances from Thielen (8-123-2), Henry (133-1), and Gordon (84-2) were encouraging. Nevertheless, an 0-2 to fall back to the pack was obviously not a desirable outcome. JuJu Smith-Schuster's toe injury is worth monitoring.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>6. Fuck you Mason: 13-9 (5)</strong> -- Already missing D'Andre Swift, losing Julio Jones could be tough to overcome. To Kyle's delight, Ronald Jones decided to have his worst game of the season, allowing Fuck you Mason to secure a double win week, despite Tua's awful performance. Tyreek Hill had a pretty sweet game Sunday night.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>7. Watson Watsoff: 13-9 (8)</strong> --  Ezekiel Elliott, Davante Adams, an Diontae Johnson had 100+ yards each to lead the squad to two key wins. One of four teams tied at nine losses, every playoff spot is technically in play with two weeks remaining.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>8. Judge Jeudy's Court: 11-11 (7)</strong> -- Duke Johnson is not a good running back even with additional touches. On the other hand, J.K. Dobbins is a true three-down talent who could be a top ten back if he weren't sharing touches with Ingram and Edwards. (Edit: Dobbins is now on the COVID-19 list.) Kyler Murray needs to watch some Packers and Chargers games and start peppering DeAndre Hopkins with 12+ targets a game the way Rodgers and Herbert do with Adams and Allen, respectively.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>9. Lock in On That Win: 10-12 (9)</strong> -- Leaving Tyler Lockett on the bench in favor of Alshon Jeffery almost cost a win, but Robert Woods's monster game Monday night got the team back in the win column after a lengthy losing streak.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>10. Beginner's Luck: 5-17 (10)</strong> -- Michael Thomas revival game with Taysom Hill at QB? Can't say I saw that coming. This team is playing spoilsport in beating teams' vying for playoff spots.</p> <br>
    <p><strong>11. New England Cheaters: 6-16 (11)</strong> -- Alvin Kamara did not record a catch for the first time in his career. No running back, receiver, or tight end had over 50 scrimmage yards this week despite having 5 touchdowns. A bad day could have been even worse without the touchdowns, I guess?</p> <br>
    <p><strong>12. Tittsburgh Feelers: 1-121 (13)</strong> -- Joe Burrow is sadly out of the season. This may have the effect of killing all fantasy value for relevant Bengals (Boyd, Higgins, A.J. Green, Bernard, and Mixon). Marquez Valdes-Scantling is a mistake waiting to happen. On Sunday he fumbled away a chance for a Packers' win and washing away all memory of the catch that setup a game-tying FG at the end of regulation.</p> <br>
