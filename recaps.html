    <h2>Week 2 Recap</h2>
    <h4>9/17/2019</h4>
    <p>In the most lopsided matchup of the week, <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (136.64) defeated <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (82.9). 'Elite'QBs' studs, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> (20.2) and <strong>Julio Jones</strong> (25.1) played
      like...well, studs, to lead the effort. <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (6.3) was mostly shut down by a surprisingly improved Buccaneers' defense, a cause for concern going forward for <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong>.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey's teammate, <strong>Cam Newton</strong> (11.32), looking more like Joe Flacco these days, continued to disappoint for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (106.02). Newton's lack of running game so far and inability to throw a
      football with good accuracy beyond 10 yards make it difficult to be successful. <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (107.12) overcame <strong>Drew Brees'</strong> (0.52) thumb injury, which he suffered on botched high-five attempt with Rams'
      defensive beast
      Aaron Donald. Brees probably shouldn't fraternize with the opponent during the game next time. <strong>Robby Anderson</strong> (10.1) put Cheaters ahead for good late in garbage time of the Monday night game with a reception thrown by some guy
      named Luke Falk. </p>   
      <p><strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (112.16) coasted to an easy win behind <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> (21.7) and <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (20.3) to remain in first place. It's never a good sign when a team leaves more points on the
      their bench (84.52) than in their starting lineup (64.86), as was the case for Miguel's Team this week. It may be time to trade one of three QBs on the roster (<strong>Rodgers, Jackson, Dalton)</strong> and cut bait with <strong>Eli
        Rogers</strong>, a wide receiver not currently employed by an NFL team.</p>

      <p><strong>Team Double Dipp's</strong> quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes'</strong> (31.62) domination of Gruden's Raiders in the 2nd quarter on Sunday (4 passing touchdowns) and a nice performance by <strong>Vance McDonald</strong> led to
      victory over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong>. Struggling to fill the void caused by <strong>Tyreek Hill's</strong> absence, JRV's<strong> Latavius Murray </strong> could only muster 2.8 points in the second flex spot. Friendly tip for all:
      any player with a red 'O' or 'IR' designation next to their name can be added to the IR spot on the roster, which frees up a spot to make an add without a corresponding drop.</p>
    <p>In one of the most impressive showings of the week, <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (138.76) put a hurt on <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (126.02). Zeke and Destroy had a balanced scoring attack, getting more than 10 points from every skill
      position in the lineup, except <strong>Josh Gordon</strong> (2.9).<strong> Fuck you Mason</strong> may be feeling some regret by leaving <strong>John Ross</strong> (19.2) and <strong>Terry McLaurin</strong> (14.7) on his bench in favor of week 1
      breakout star <strong>T.J. Hockenson</strong> (1.2). Starting one of the listed two players would have been the difference between a loss and win in this tight matchup.</p>
    <p><strong>Odell Beckham's</strong> (25.1) 161 receiving yards against the Jets propelled <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> to a come-from-behind conquest of <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong>.<strong> David Njoku's</strong> (0) early exit and the general
      ineffectiveness of <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (7.3) and <strong>Duke Johnson</strong> (3.1) in the run game made it impossible for Get Ridley Of 'Em to keep pace.
      <p>Remember to get your FAAB bids in on Tuesday night for the best chance to get the players you are targeting. I'd like to see even more people involved. Good luck in week 3!</p>  
      
    <h2>Week 1 Recap</h2>
    <h4>9/11/2019</h4>
    <p>What a start to the season for <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (189.62), scoring a league-high in points in week 1! Baby got Mack's team was paced by monster performances by <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (42.3) and <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (36.4), sailing to an easy victory over <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (126.34), who struggled to overcome subpar outings from fantasy stalwarts <strong>Cam Newton</strong> (6.36) and <strong>Davante Adams</strong> (5.6).</p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (139.5) eked out the a win over <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (136.44) by the smallest margin of all matchups this week. Cheaters' efforts were boosted by the boom-or-bust master <strong>DeSean Jackson</strong> exploding for 2 TDs (31.4). Zeke and
      Destroy performed admirably this week due in part to their reliance/possible over reliance on Vikings <strong>(Diggs, Thielen, Cook)</strong> and Patriots <strong>(Gordon, White, Brady, Gostkowski)</strong>. </p>
<img class="bold-strategy-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/65os7odbIW6pa/giphy.gif" alt="bold-strategy-cotton">
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (109.94) was hampered by some less-than-stellar showings by key contributors <strong>Jared Goff</strong> (10.44), <strong>Sony Michel</strong> (1.4), and <strong>Mike Williams</strong> (3.4). These underperformances made it difficult to beat <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> (132.06) big games from
      <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (37.9), <strong>T.Y. Hilton</strong> (24.7), and <strong>Mark Ingram II</strong> (22.7). All three of these top scorers had higher point totals than anyone on Fuck you Mason's team.</p>
    <p><strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> rode <strong>Derrick Henry's</strong> (28.4) strong performance, which was highlighted by a 75-yard catch and run to the endzone, to triumph over <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong>. Double Dipp's squad struggled mightily with no players other than <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> (27.32) and
      <strong>Michael Thomas</strong> (17.3) reaching double digit points.</p>
    <p>Injuries to <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (12.4), <strong>Tyreek Hill</strong> (3.1), <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> (6.6), and <strong>Matt Breida</strong> (3.7) were the story for <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> on Sunday afternoon. <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> secured the "dub" behind solid, yet unspectacular production from
      <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> (16.64), <strong>David Johnson</strong> (22.7), and <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> (19.6). </p>
    <p>The most disappointing performance of week 1 was <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (52.62) getting stomped by <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (132.8)! Miguel's team was set up for failure from the get-go by not starting a second WR, and getting a goose egg on the scoreboard
      from <strong>Jaron Brown</strong>. Get Ridley Of 'Em took full advantage of the soft matchup and coasted to 1-0, aided by the strong right arm of <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (33.4) and the powerful legs of <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (25.4).</p>
    <p>If you're unhappy with how week 1 unfolded, the good news is that there's a long season ahead and plenty of time to still make the playoffs. If you're riding high off winning the week, don't get ahead of yourself. Week 1/early season is
      usually a wild and unpredictable time, so I'd advise to not act rashly. Play the waiver wire, make some trades, have some fun. Good luck in week 2.</p>
