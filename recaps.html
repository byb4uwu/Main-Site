    <h2>Week 12 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/28/2019</h4>
    <p>Talk about efficiency for <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong> (36.26), who had 5 TD passes, 169 passing yards and 95 rushing yards. <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (148.96) didn't even need Lamar's MVP-caliber performance as <strong>Derrick Henry</strong> (28) erupted, himself. <strong>IWillMakeAComback's</strong> (67.24) team looks kinda like a wilted, unloved plant.</p>
    <p>This week was a <strong>Chris Godwin</strong> (33.9) week (as opposed to a Mike Evans week) for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (123.20). Gurley brought formerly sole first place player <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (94.42) down a notch. Let's see if Mack can turn it around next week, or simply limps into the playoffs on a losing streak.</p>
    <p>In the most surprsing result of the week, <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (112.60) defeated <strong>Superman Barkley</strong> (81.04) despite not having an active QB, Flex, or Kicker. This could play a role in the competition for the 6th and final playoff spot (total points scored). All of Barkley's players underachieved greatly this week, with <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> (11.9) being the leading scorer. </p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (106.62) is trying their best to get back into the playoff hunt. Rolling the dice with Jameis Winston (26.32) over Drew Brees this week paid off. <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (94.06) fell to a third straight loss, and playoffs look to be out of sight, barring an incredible Week 13.</p>
    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (95.68) did the minimum necessary to beat cellar-dweller <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (69.26). It wasn't pretty, but with a record of 7-5, Ridley looks to have a chance to sneak into the playoffs on merit of record. To advance, however, they will need more support from <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (7.88) and <strong>Jamison Crowder</strong> (2.8).</p>
    <p><strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (97.04) lost ground again and now sits on the outside looking in on the playoffs. <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (104.1) moves into a tie for first place, even with <strong>Amari Cooper's</strong> (0) and <strong>Russell Wilson's</strong> (10.5) worst game of the season, respectively.</p>
    <img class="dak-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l3tD98jvDNlkc/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <p>Week 13 concludes the regular season, but there is still a lot on the line. The last three playoff spots are at stake, as well as first round byes (top 2). Happy Thanksgiving, set those lineups, and we'll see how it all plays out!</p>
    <h2>Week 11 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/19/2019</h4>
    <p>Let's get the biggest snooze fest out of the way first. <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (100.34) more than quadrupled up <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (23.8). <strong>Josh Allen</strong> (33.84) accounted for 4 touchdowns and <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> had his best fantasy game since week 4 and most rushing yards since week 1. This is a good sign for Gurley Gone Crazy's playoff push.</p>
    <p>Another week, another win for <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (112.76). Despite possibly <strong>Deshaun Watson's</strong> (4.96) worst game as a pro, <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (17.2) was dynamic as a pass catcher out of the backfield for Old Man Rivers on Monday night. <strong>Zeke and Destroy's</strong> (97.26) <strong>Tom Brady</strong>-led (8.54) Patriots offense continues to show its flaws. </p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (142.42) showed off their might in week 11, but remained mired in 9th place overall. <strong>John Brown</strong> (30.2) and an emergent <strong>Deebo Samuel</strong> (17.4) paved the way to victory. <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> (74.24) <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (24.6) sadly remains relegated to a bench role.</p>
    <p>Behind the efforts of <strong>Keenan Allen</strong> (17.1), <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (120.38) was able to stave off the comeback attempt by <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (108.18). <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> (16.18), rarely a disappointment, scored his least fantasy points of the season (outside of the game he left with injury). Team Double Dipp is among the teams struggling to make the playoffs. </p>
    <p>The <strong>Jimmy Garropolo</strong> (31.66) critics must shut up for at least a week as Jimmy G passed for 424 yards and 4 TDs (plus, a game winning drive) for <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (122.36). Once again a loser, <strong>Superman Barkley</strong> (100.22) now sits in 10th place. However, on account of having the most points scored outside the top 5 in the standings, Barkley would be in line for a playoff berth if the season ended today.</p>
    <img class="dak-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/yyUWg5ECNhqlW/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <figcaption><strong>Jimmy G right now</strong></figcaption>
    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (94.16) got a much needed win over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (57). Next week may be a rough one for Ridley, as <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (16.9), <strong>James Conner</strong> (4.7), <strong>Eric Ebron</strong> (4.7), and <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (3.1) were all injured in their respective games. <strong>Robert Woods</strong> (0) also missed his game due to to a personal issue. JRV lost a precious game in the standings when he left <strong>Matthew Stafford's</strong> (0) fractured back, <strong>Matt Brieda's</strong> bad ankle (0), and <strong>Nobody</strong> (0) in the starting lineup.</p>
    <p>Two weeks remain before the playoffs start. Baby got Mack and Wilson1getmeabeer have both clinched spots. There are still 8(!) teams in the hunt for the remaining 4 spots. Once again, the 6th playoff spot goes to the team with the most points scored outside the top 5. Let's get it!                                 
</p>
    <h2>Week 10 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/12/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (131.2) flexed their muscles with the league's top points total without <strong>Matthew Stafford</strong> (inactive) or <strong>Marquez Valdez-Scantling</strong> contributing. <strong>Tyreek Hill</strong> (27.5) and <strong>Chris Carson</strong> (27.3) more than made up for the hobbled/irrelevant. <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> lost (37.52).</p>
    <p><strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (85.78) recorded their sixth straight win, taking down <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (65.18). Mack overcame the biggest bye week of the season, while Comeback left their stars out of the starting lineup including <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (23.1).</p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (122.98) lost a fourth straight week, this time to <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (124.24), who ended a four game slide. Cheaters' <strong>Christian Kirk</strong> (34.8) finally had the breakout many were expecting in 2019 with three touchdown grabs. <strong>Patrick Mahomes'</strong> (29.84) return from the sideline was a triumphant one for Double Dipp.</p>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (116.44) continues to move up in the standings, now sitting in 5th place. <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (102.56) had a chance to make a comeback on Monday night, but got next to nothing from receivers <strong>Josh Gordon</strong> (3.7) and <strong>Emmanuel Sanders</strong> (3.4). <strong>Josh Allen</strong> (25.44) found the endzone twice on Sunday (5th straight game, longest active streak in NFL) to lead the way for Gurley. </p>
    <p><strong>Superman Barkley's</strong> (80.02) big trade for <strong>Jared Goff</strong> (5.72) and <strong>Saquon Barkley</strong> (5.6) is not looking so hot right now. <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em's</strong> (100.88) <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (26.88) was on fire--in the game and in pregame (see below).</p>
    <img class="dak-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YRE1Du6ewxjFOG1RN9/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <figcaption><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUT5rEU6pqM">Hips don't lie</a></strong></figcaption>
    <p>In a matchup between upper echelon teams in BelichickYourselfB4UWreckUrself <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (125.42) gained ground on <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (119.28). Fuck you Mason may be concerned by a obviously hindered <strong>David Johnson</strong> (-0.5) for the championship push. Wilson's <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> (17.58) keeps the squad (and the Seahawks) competitive in every matchup.</p>

    <h2>Week 9 Recap</h2>
    <h4>11/6/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (127.22) was the Week 9 leader in total points, routing <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (78.9). <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> (39.22) continued his MVP-caliber campaign with 5 passing TDs to increase his TD/INT ratio to an absurd 22/1 in '19. For Cheaters, <strong>Tyler Lockett</strong> (33.7) was on the receiving end of two 6-pointers from Wilson (6 on the year).</p>
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason's</strong> (108.32) blockbuster deal (L.Jackson/D.Henry/G.Kittle for S.Barkley/M.Williams/J.Goff) immediately paid big dividends as <strong>Jackson</strong> (28.62), <strong>Henry</strong> (23.4), and <strong>Kittle</strong> (16.9) were the top three scorers for the team. <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (96.78) struggled to score as <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (3.1) continues to miss Big Ben. Mason Rudolph can only be trusted to dump off to <strong>Jaylen Samuels as he did 13 times on Sunday</strong> (12.8).</p>
    <p>In the closest matchup of the week, <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (125.64) remained in first place, edging <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (119.4), who continues to slide down the standings. Mack played a kicker on bye and Double Dipp started an "active" but unused <strong>Chris Herndon</strong> (0). </p>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (98.8) lucked into a victory, defeating <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (88.5), who left all their good players on the bench. In fact, Comeback left a whopping 108.94 points on the bench in the form of <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (36.1), <strong>Mike Evans</strong> (30), <strong>Kyler Murray</strong> (23.04), and <strong>Damien Williams</strong> (19.8). Gurley had a rough bye week, plus top receivers <strong>Chris Godwin</strong> (10.4) and <strong>Davante Adams</strong> (7.6) didn't do much in the their games, respectively.</p>
    <p>In the least surprising result of the week, <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (106.4) steamrolled <strong>Miguel's Team's</strong> (66.54) incomplete lineup. For Zeke, <strong>Emmanuel Sanders</strong> (20.7) appears to have a growing connection with Jimmy Garoppolo after recording 7 catches for over 100 yards and a touchdown last Thursday in his second game with the 9ers.</p>
    <img class="sarcastic-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/9SJ9LEOD0QbK1mhxu4/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <p><strong>Superman Barkley</strong> (100.56) was unable to complete the Monday night comeback, falling to <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (109.54). <strong>Saquon Barkley</strong> (12.5) and <strong>Michael Gallup</strong> (10.3) were Superman's losers on ESPN. JRV's <strong>Tyreek Hill</strong> (23.5) performed like the NFL's best deep ball threat--even without Patrick Mahomes at QB.</p>
    <p>Please make your roster moves early in the week and set your lineups, too. This allows for injuries to your players, forgetfulness, laziness, and the general busyness of life to not get in the way of your fantasy football success. With that being said, Week 10 is a major bye week (6 teams out of action). Also, the trade deadline is this Saturday 11/9. Only 4 weeks until playoffs...</p>

    <h2>Week 8 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/29/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> (27.76) broke a tackle, got kicked in the eye, moved out of the pocket, avoided another tackle, threw a touchdown pass, and vaulted <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (119.16) into first place over <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (91.68). Also contributing for Mack were <strong>Julian Edelman</strong> (23.5) and <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> (25.3) with two touchdowns apiece. Wilson's <strong>Melvin Gordon III</strong> (10.4) continues to struggle coming off his holdout.</p>
    <p>Another beastly showing from <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> (38.1) was a big part of <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (149.08) being the week's top scorer. JRV even had <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> (36.8) on his bench, yet overtook loser <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (112.78) in the standings. Fuck you Mason had a few disappointing performances including <strong>Terry McLaurin</strong> (5.9), <strong>Chase Edmonds</strong> (2.3), and <strong>T.J. Hockenson</strong> (2.6). </p>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (114.26) ended a three game losing streak behind another dominant rushing/receiving day from <strong>Latavius Murray</strong> (32.2) in Alvin Kamara's absence. The defeated <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (100.9) had <strong>Michael Thomas</strong> (21.8) ball out, as usual, but nobody else stepped up to end a rough patch for the squad. Thomas is on pace for an insane 146 catches this season.</p>
    <img class="gurley-throw-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/JPmqmy3XhgPQFjbqGY/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <figcaption><strong>Was the Todd auditioning for QB on this celebration in London?</strong></figcaption>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (65.28) must be tanking for Tua this week with two players on bye--<strong>Mark Andrews</strong> (0) and <strong>Justin Tucker</strong> (0). <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (109.42) survived to move to 4-4. <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (18.8), one of the season's biggest busts accounting for draft position had his best game of the year with over 100 receiving yards.</p>
    <p><strong>EliteQBLamar</strong> (143.68) enjoyed a pseudo-bye week win over <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (61.2). <strong>Cooper Kupp's</strong> (31.5) demolition of the Bengals' secondary on Sunday was the biggest contributor.</p>
    <p><strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (99.56) lucked out against inattentive <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> (54.5) lacking lineup. <strong>Dalvin Cook</strong> (25.6) and <strong>Tom Brady</strong> (18.36) both did their thing for Zeke.</p>
    <p>Please set your lineups as we enter the most dense bye weeks (9-11). It's more fun and fair when everyone is trying to win, in my opinion. Also, a reminder that the trade deadline is November 9.</p>
    <h2>Week 7 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/22/2019</h4>
    <p>The highest scorer of the week was <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (123), despite kicker <strong>Matt Gay</strong> (0) on bye but in the starting lineup. JRV was paced by solid performances from <strong>Gardner Minshew II</strong> (21), <strong>DeAndre Hopkins</strong> (21.1), and <strong>Marquez Valez-Scantling</strong> (20.3). On the negative side of the matchup, <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (107.44) surely missed the services of the injured <strong>Alvin Kamara</strong>. In Kamara's stead, <strong>Rashaad Penny</strong> (0) contributed no points to the scoreboard.</p>
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (104.92) snuck by <strong>EliteQBLamar</strong> (103.32) even after <strong>David Johnson</strong> (0.2) and <strong>Terry McLaurin</strong> (1.6) had their worst games of the season, respectively. Lamar's <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> (7.4) struggled and may continue to struggle with Patrick Mahomes out multiple weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (92.48) is likely still crying after leaving <strong>Latavius Murray</strong> (29.5) on the bench in a loss to <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (110.44). Wilson continues to reap the rewards of trading for <strong>Stefon Diggs</strong> (17.7).</p>
    <p><strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (107.12) continued their winning ways in routing <strong>Get Ridley 'Of Em</strong> (69.56). For Ridley, only <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (21.56) and <strong>Robert Woods</strong> (11.1) reached double digit points. Mack got nice production from running backs <strong>Ezequiel Elliott</strong> (23.7) and <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (22).</p>
    <p><strong>Dalvin Cook</strong> (27.4) continued his domination of the NFL on Sunday for <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (108.56). <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> was in for a tough weekend when <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> (7.24) went down with an injury mid-game. Plus, anytime <strong>Nyheim Hines</strong> (2.1) is in a starting role for a fantasy team, you know you're in trouble. </p>
    <p>In the lowest scoring matchup this week (and this season), <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (65.56) took down <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (59.06). IWillMakeAComeback's very low total points scored is notable because every player in the lineup actually suited up for their games. On the other hand, <strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> (43.76) did almost all the heavy lifting for Miguel.</p>
    <img class="jets-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VD4Bt6Pj89UiLcUtZ4/giphy.gif" alt="">
    <figcaption><strong>Hopefully nobody is a Jets fan after their thrashing at the hands of Belichick and Co. in Week 7...</strong></figcaption>
    <h2>Week 6 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/16/2019</h4>
    <p>Quick hits this week:</p>
    <p><strong>EliteQBLamar's</strong> (107.94) newest trade acquisition <strong>Lamar Jackson</strong> (30.64) wasn't enough to topple <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (111.7). Cheaters met his original Yahoo projection within a point behind <strong>Devonta Freeman's</strong> (25.3) two receiving touchdowns, a career high for the stocky RB.</p>
    <p><strong>Jared Goff</strong> (1.12) did nothing to silence his critcs and did very little to help <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (121.72). Nevertheless, Fuck you Mason had no trouble putting away <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (78.32) running with his usual crew of Eli Rogers (0, unemployed) and Co.</p>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (96.92) had 6 injured/on bye players this week (<strong>Gurley, Adams, Shephard, Allen, Jacobs, Engram</strong>). The only active player on Gurley's bench, <strong>Hunter Henry</strong> (26), would have been the differece maker against <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (114.68). <strong>James Conner</strong> (27.4) put an exclamation point on the victory Sunday night with two touchdowns.</p>
    <p><strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (111.5) continued their winning ways, upending <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (105.36) to take sole possession of first place (5-1). <strong>Will Disly's</strong> (0) season ending injury leaves Wilson vulernable at the tight end positon, however. Zeke's <strong>Leveon Bell</strong> (11.8) may have better days ahead as Sam Darnold reacclimates to the Jets' offense in the coming weeks. </p>
    <p>In week 6, <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (107.64) lived up to his name despite not setting a lineup (<strong>Miller</strong> and <strong>Hilton</strong> on bye). <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (105.82) lost grip of first place due in part to lack of productivity from wide receivers <strong>Jarvis Landry</strong> (5.1), <strong>Mohamed Sanu</strong> (4.4), and <strong>Preston Williams</strong> (4.1).</p>
    <p>A week after <strong>James Robert Vagina's</strong> (107.62) <strong>Philadelphia</strong> (-1.5) put up 27 points, they were dominated by Stefon Diggs and...Kirk Cousins 😲. Meanwhile, <strong>Baby got Mack's</strong> (132.80) defense <strong>Denver</strong> (18) pitched a shutout against Tennessee.</p>
    <p>Week 7 marks the halfway mark in the fantasy regular season. Keep up the good work and:</p>

    <h2>Week 5 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/8/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (145.44) vaulted to the top of the standings with another blowout victory over <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (91.72). <strong>Michael Thomas</strong> (35.7) was the beneficiary of Teddy Bridgewater finally getting his deep ball going. <strong>Leonard Fournette</strong> (21.7) and <strong>Phillip Lindsay</strong> (22.7) had excellent games, both topping 100 yards rushing. The biggest fantasy performance of the season came this week in the form of <strong>Will Fuller V's</strong> (46.7) 200+ receiving yards and 3 TDs. Fuller accounted for over 50% of Miguel's Team's points this week. That's not a recipe for success.</p>
    <p><strong>Aaron Jones</strong> (45.7) almost matched Fuller's fantasy output with 4 touchdowns for the Packers and <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (136.2). <strong>Philadelphia's</strong> (27.5) 10 sacks and two defensive touchdowns helped overcome <strong>Baker Mayfield's</strong> (0) abysmal showing on Monday night (100 passing yards, 2 INTs, lost fumble). The real loser, however, was <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (134.04), in leaving <strong>Josh Jacobs'</strong> (27.8) breakout against the Bears defense on the bench in favor of <strong>Geronimo Allison</strong> (3.8). <strong>Jacoby Brissett</strong> (11.94) disappointed, as well, despite the Colts upsetting the Chiefs.</p>
    <p><strong>Deshaun Watson</strong> (41.74) finally had the monster game he is known for in guiding <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (129.04) over <strong>EliteQBLamar</strong> (120.06). Mack balanced zeros from <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> and <strong>Phillip Dorsett</strong> with nice days at the office for <strong>Julian Edelman</strong> (21) and <strong>Ezekiel Elliott</strong> (16.1). <strong>George Kittle</strong> (17.8) scored a touchdown for the first time in 2019 for Lamar.</p>
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (119.1) rode the wave of quickly emerging receiver <strong>DJ Chark Jr</strong> (32.4) to down <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (103.38). <strong>Sony Michel</strong> (19.8) had his best game of the season, by far, and was Fuck you Mason's second highest scorer. On the other hand, Cheaters had no standout performances--<strong>Justin Tucker</strong> (16) was the team's second highest scorer.</p>
<img class="chark-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/PjlsFdn7qs2XcvluHE/giphy.gif" alt="chark">
<figcaption><strong>🎵 Baby (DJ) Chark, two two twotwotwo (TDs) 🎵</strong></figcaption>
    <p><strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (143.32) righted the ship with a destruction of <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (125.72). Unsurprisingly for <strong>Adam Thielen</strong> (28.5), a week after calling out his quarterback, he received plenty of targets and turned them into 130 yards and 2 TDs to the delight of Zeke. Ridley's group put up a valiant effort, led by <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (26.22), <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (15), and <strong>Calvin Ridley</strong> (17.3). Tight end production was practically non-existent in this matchup with <strong>Eric Ebron</strong> (1.3) and <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> (0) failing to make an meaningful impact.</p>
    <p><strong>Wilson1getmeabeer's</strong> (141.02) <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> (29.92) continued his remarkable efficiency and accuracy with four passing TDs in week 5 and no interceptions on the season. <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> (34.1) and <strong>Allen Robinson</strong> (25.2) achieved like true number one wideout talents. <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (121.4) made no such comeback this week and didn't get much out of anyone not named <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (44.7).</p>

    <h2>Week 4 Recap</h2>
    <h4>10/1/2019</h4>
    <p><strong>Aaron Rodgers</strong> (26.48) and <strong>Nick Chubb</strong> (37.8) shouldered the load in <strong>Miguel's Team's</strong> (107.08) first win of the season over <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (95.6). Cheaters struggled mightily across the board with only <strong>Alvin Kamara</strong> (10.4), <strong>Devonta Freeman</strong> (14), and <strong>Mark Andrews</strong> (11.1) topping 10 points (outside of QB). Even <strong>Jameis Winston's</strong> (30.3 on bench) destruction of the Rams' defense wouldn't have been the difference between 4-0 and 3-1 for Cheaters.</p>
    <p>Winston's primary target, <strong>Chris Godwin</strong> (35.2), incredibly topped Mike Evans' yardage from last week and put up two touchdowns for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (145.82). Other contributors to the blowout effort over <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (123) were <strong>Davante Adams</strong> (23) torching the Eagles' secondary and <strong>Todd Gurley</strong> (22.5) punching into the end zone twice. 'Elite'QB reaped the benefits of Jared Goff throwing the ball over 50 times in the form of <strong>Cooper Kupp's</strong> (22.4) 9 catches for over 100 yards. 'Elite'QB's group performed admirably this week, but you can't fix Crazy.</p>
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason's</strong> (125.2) newest trade acquisition, <strong>Wayne Gallman Jr.</strong> (24.8), made a strong opening statement as lead back in New York. The Dolphins porous defense was somehow able to limit true number one receiver <strong>Keenan Allen</strong> (7.3). Continuing the theme of steady receivers being shut down this week, on the other side <strong>Baby got Mack's</strong> (123.1) <strong>Julian Edelman</strong> (5) and <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (4.9) turned in below average Sundays. Following this matchup, Baby got Mack is no longer undefeated and Fuck you Mason has a win, at long last.</p>
    <p>Another previously winless team, <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (119.44) turned in a solid week 4 act by beating <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (82.6). After having very little to work with in the game, a frustrated <strong>Adam Thielen</strong> (1.6) called out his quarterback Kirk Cousins (now 5-27 versus winning teams in his career). <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> (1.5) and <strong>Tom Brady</strong> (4.7) had dud games for Zeke this week, as well. JRV's <strong>Chris Carson</strong> (16.5) didn't fumble this week in Seattle's blowout over Arizona and <strong>Aaron Jones</strong> (14.8) fell into the end zone to save his day. Let's see if JRV can build off this step forward and keep it going in the coming weeks.</p>
    <p><strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (100.62) pulled off the Monday night comeback over <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (95.28). <strong>James Conner</strong> (22.5) finally lived up to his lofty preseason expectations to lead the way, however, <strong>JuJu Smith-Schuster</strong> (3) continues to struggle. <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's T.Y. Hilton</strong> (0) remaining in the lineup when inactive may have been the deciding factor in this week's result for <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong>.</p>
    <p>The largest score margin of the week belonged to the matchup between <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (140.1) and <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (84.7). Double Dipp had steady to above average production from almost every player in his lineup, with the exception of <strong>Phillip Lindsay</strong> (6.5) and <strong>Kyle Rudolph</strong> (1.7). Even <strong>Corey Davis</strong> (17.6), a bust thus far, decided to get in on the scoring action. For Wilson1, the case of the Week 4 missing WR1 extended to <strong>Odell Beckham Jr</strong> (3) and <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> (7.3). Let's see if the top wide receivers around the league can regain their powers next week.</p>

    <p>We're already a quarter of the way through the NFL regular season, which means even more of the fantasy regular season has elapsed. It's time for teams to distinguish themselves atop the standings. As we get towards the middle of the season, keep in the mind upcoming bye weeks when maneuvering your rosters. Keep it up!</p>
    <h2>Week 3 Recap</h2>
    <h4>9/24/2019</h4>
    <p>This week's top scorer was <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (179.06) winning over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> (116.1). <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> stars <strong>Mike Evans</strong> (41), <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (26.3), and <strong>Mark Ingram II</strong> (33.5) picked up the slack for the injured <strong>Damien Williams</strong> (0) who remained in the starting lineup. <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (10.7) was limited by the Browns' continued poor O-line play, questionable playcalling by Freddie Kitchens, and the Rams' excellent defense on Sunday night for <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong>. <strong>Darren Waller</strong> (20.6) is quickly becoming Derek Carr's favorite target as he hauled in an incredible 13 of 14 targets for 134 yards. </p>
    <p>Lead by a bounceback game by <strong>Jameis Winston</strong> (26.5) against the soft Giants secondary, <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (136.9) continued dominance and unseated last week's top dog <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (115.44). Khalil Mack's and <strong>Chicago's</strong> (13) mangling of Redskins' offensive linemen wasn't enough to compensate for the disappointing performances by receivers <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (8.9), <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> (2.7), and <strong>Marquise Brown</strong> (5.9).</p>
    <img class="jay-gruden-gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/eKZh9IvxQXjNbFHfKF/giphy.gif" alt="Jay-Gruden-gif">
    <figcaption><strong>Mack made Jay Gruden look like this a lot on Monday.</strong></figcaption>
    <p><strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (129.12) reached the win column for the first time in 2019, squeaking past <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (127.26) by a hair. <strong>Fuck you Mason's</strong> hopes were dashed by the high ankle sprain of number one fantasy draft pick <strong>Saquon Barkley</strong> (5.7). It remains to be seen how his 233 pound void will be filled. <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy's</strong> day was highlighted by speedster <strong>Mecole Hardman</strong> (17.4) reaching 21 mph on a long touchdown reception from Mahomes.</p>
    <p>Moving to 3-0 was <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (128.06) with another strong performance from <strong>Julio Jones</strong> (22.8) and <strong>Cooper Kupp</strong> (27.7). 'Elite'QB's only concern near the top of the standings now might be why <strong>George Kittle</strong> (8.7) isn't getting the ball more often from Jimmy G. <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (117.74) came out on the losing side of the matchup partially due to leaving <strong>James White</strong> (0) in the lineup while the Pats' RB was attending the birth of his child. Grandpa <strong>Greg Olsen</strong> keeps on kickin' with two more touchdowns.</p>
    <p><strong>Philip Lindsay's</strong> (27) best performance of the still young season powered <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong> (116.66) to a second win of the season, defeating <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (104.84). <strong>Calvin Ridley</strong> (1.1), the team's namesake, let the group down, but below average games from <strong>Robert Woods</strong> (7.3) and <strong>James Conner</strong> (5.7) would have made it difficult to compete, anyways.</p>
    <p>The final matchup of the week pitted <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> (142.04) against lowest scorer of the week <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (67.9). Miguel's roster neglect is certainly paying off--if the goal is a last place finish. On the other hand, Wilson1getmeabeer's squad was anchored by <strong>Russell Wilson's</strong> garbage time fantasy points and potential diamond in the rough TE <strong>Will Dissly</strong> (15.2). </p>
    <p>For those of you putting in the work and improving your teams on a weekly basis, keep it up! For those of you slacking off, it's time to get your head in the game. There's still time to save the season, (unlike the Dolphins) but you must start now!</p>

    <h2>Week 2 Recap</h2>
    <h4>9/17/2019</h4>
    <p>In the most lopsided matchup of the week, <strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> (136.64) defeated <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong> (82.9). 'Elite'QBs' studs, <strong>Travis Kelce</strong> (20.2) and <strong>Julio Jones</strong> (25.1) played
      like...well, studs, to lead the effort. <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (6.3) was mostly shut down by a surprisingly improved Buccaneers' defense, a cause for concern going forward for <strong>IWillMakeAComeback</strong>.</p>
      <p>McCaffrey's teammate, <strong>Cam Newton</strong> (11.32), looking more like Joe Flacco these days, continued to disappoint for <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (106.02). Newton's lack of running game so far and inability to throw a
      football with good accuracy beyond 10 yards make it difficult to be successful. <strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (107.12) overcame <strong>Drew Brees'</strong> (0.52) thumb injury, which he suffered on botched high-five attempt with Rams'
      defensive beast
      Aaron Donald. Brees probably shouldn't fraternize with the opponent during the game next time. <strong>Robby Anderson</strong> (10.1) put Cheaters ahead for good late in garbage time of the Monday night game with a reception thrown by some guy
      named Luke Falk. </p>   
      <p><strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (112.16) coasted to an easy win behind <strong>Kenny Golladay</strong> (21.7) and <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (20.3) to remain in first place. It's never a good sign when a team leaves more points on the
      their bench (84.52) than in their starting lineup (64.86), as was the case for Miguel's Team this week. It may be time to trade one of three QBs on the roster (<strong>Rodgers, Jackson, Dalton)</strong> and cut bait with <strong>Eli
        Rogers</strong>, a wide receiver not currently employed by an NFL team.</p>  
    <img class="conan-why-gif" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l2JhtKtDWYNKdRpoA/giphy.gif" alt="why-conan">

      <p><strong>Team Double Dipp's</strong> quarterback <strong>Patrick Mahomes'</strong> (31.62) domination of Gruden's Raiders in the 2nd quarter on Sunday (4 passing touchdowns) and a nice performance by <strong>Vance McDonald</strong> led to
      victory over <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong>. Struggling to fill the void caused by <strong>Tyreek Hill's</strong> absence, JRV's<strong> Latavius Murray </strong> could only muster 2.8 points in the second flex spot. Friendly tip for all:
      any player with a red 'O' or 'IR' designation next to their name can be added to the IR spot on the roster, which frees up a spot to make an add without a corresponding drop.</p>
    <p>In one of the most impressive showings of the week, <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (138.76) put a hurt on <strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (126.02). Zeke and Destroy had a balanced scoring attack, getting more than 10 points from every skill
      position in the lineup, except <strong>Josh Gordon</strong> (2.9).<strong> Fuck you Mason</strong> may be feeling some regret by leaving <strong>John Ross</strong> (19.2) and <strong>Terry McLaurin</strong> (14.7) on his bench in favor of week 1
      breakout star <strong>T.J. Hockenson</strong> (1.2). Starting one of the listed two players would have been the difference between a loss and win in this tight matchup.</p>
    <p><strong>Odell Beckham's</strong> (25.1) 161 receiving yards against the Jets propelled <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> to a come-from-behind conquest of <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong>.<strong> David Njoku's</strong> (0) early exit and the general
      ineffectiveness of <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (7.3) and <strong>Duke Johnson</strong> (3.1) in the run game made it impossible for Get Ridley Of 'Em to keep pace.
      <p>Remember to get your FAAB bids in on Tuesday night for the best chance to get the players you are targeting. I'd like to see even more people involved. Good luck in week 3!</p>  

    <h2>Week 1 Recap</h2>
    <h4>9/11/2019</h4>
    <p>What a start to the season for <strong>Baby got Mack</strong> (189.62), scoring a league-high in points in week 1! Baby got Mack's team was paced by monster performances by <strong>Sammy Watkins</strong> (42.3) and <strong>Austin Ekeler</strong> (36.4), sailing to an easy victory over <strong>Gurley Gone Crazy</strong> (126.34), who struggled to overcome subpar outings from fantasy stalwarts <strong>Cam Newton</strong> (6.36) and <strong>Davante Adams</strong> (5.6).</p>
    <p><strong>New England Cheaters</strong> (139.5) eked out the a win over <strong>Zeke and Destroy</strong> (136.44) by the smallest margin of all matchups this week. Cheaters' efforts were boosted by the boom-or-bust master <strong>DeSean Jackson</strong> exploding for 2 TDs (31.4). Zeke and
      Destroy performed admirably this week due in part to their reliance/possible over reliance on Vikings <strong>(Diggs, Thielen, Cook)</strong> and Patriots <strong>(Gordon, White, Brady, Gostkowski)</strong>. </p>
<img class="bold-strategy-gif"src="https://media.giphy.com/media/65os7odbIW6pa/giphy.gif" alt="bold-strategy-cotton">
    <p><strong>Fuck you Mason</strong> (109.94) was hampered by some less-than-stellar showings by key contributors <strong>Jared Goff</strong> (10.44), <strong>Sony Michel</strong> (1.4), and <strong>Mike Williams</strong> (3.4). These underperformances made it difficult to beat <strong>IWillMakeAComeback's</strong> (132.06) big games from
      <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong> (37.9), <strong>T.Y. Hilton</strong> (24.7), and <strong>Mark Ingram II</strong> (22.7). All three of these top scorers had higher point totals than anyone on Fuck you Mason's team.</p>
    <p><strong>'Elite'QBFlacco</strong> rode <strong>Derrick Henry's</strong> (28.4) strong performance, which was highlighted by a 75-yard catch and run to the endzone, to triumph over <strong>Team Double Dipp</strong>. Double Dipp's squad struggled mightily with no players other than <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong> (27.32) and
      <strong>Michael Thomas</strong> (17.3) reaching double digit points.</p>
    <p>Injuries to <strong>Baker Mayfield</strong> (12.4), <strong>Tyreek Hill</strong> (3.1), <strong>Tevin Coleman</strong> (6.6), and <strong>Matt Breida</strong> (3.7) were the story for <strong>James Robert Vagina</strong> on Sunday afternoon. <strong>Wilson1getmeabeer</strong> secured the "dub" behind solid, yet unspectacular production from
      <strong>Russell Wilson</strong> (16.64), <strong>David Johnson</strong> (22.7), and <strong>Amari Cooper</strong> (19.6). </p>
    <p>The most disappointing performance of week 1 was <strong>Miguel's Team</strong> (52.62) getting stomped by <strong>Get Ridley Of 'Em</strong> (132.8)! Miguel's team was set up for failure from the get-go by not starting a second WR, and getting a goose egg on the scoreboard
      from <strong>Jaron Brown</strong>. Get Ridley Of 'Em took full advantage of the soft matchup and coasted to 1-0, aided by the strong right arm of <strong>Dak Prescott</strong> (33.4) and the powerful legs of <strong>Marlon Mack</strong> (25.4).</p>
    <p>If you're unhappy with how week 1 unfolded, the good news is that there's a long season ahead and plenty of time to still make the playoffs. If you're riding high off winning the week, don't get ahead of yourself. Week 1/early season is
      usually a wild and unpredictable time, so I'd advise to not act rashly. Play the waiver wire, make some trades, have some fun. Good luck in week 2.</p>
